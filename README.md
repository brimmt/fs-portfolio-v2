# Professional Portfolio V2  

## Overview  
This is the second version of my personal portfolio website — a clean, glassmorphic, one-page layout built completely from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  


The goal of this rebuild was to push my **frontend fundamentals** further. While my first portfolio was partially AI-assisted, this version reflects a more hands-on approach. I’m deliberately taking my time to write, debug, and understand every section to strengthen my foundation as a developer.

---

## Purpose  
This portfolio represents my growth as a **frontend and full-stack developer**, as well as my ability to design interactive, responsive, and aesthetically balanced user interfaces. It’s also the base for future experiments, including an updated version of **BrimmBot**, my personal AI assistant.

## Sections  
- **Home** – Introduction and background  
- **Skills** – Categorized by frontend, backend, AI, data, and Other  
- **Projects** – Glassmorphic project cards with interactive drawers  
- **Contact** – Direct email and links to GitHub / LinkedIn  
- **BrimmBot Revamp (Coming Soon)** – Integrated chatbot with a clean UI
